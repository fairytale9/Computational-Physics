Course project: Calculation of Critical Point of Percolation Model by Machine Learning


### Description
The basic idea is to regard a percolation model instance as a picture. 
Due to the qualitative transition from uncontected to contected state of the percolation model, the prediction of it may be unstable near this point.
Based on this assumption, I conducted the experiment to prove the viability of calculating the critical point by machine learning.
